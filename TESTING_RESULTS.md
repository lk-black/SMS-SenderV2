# 🎉 SMS Recovery Service - Deployment & Testing Results

**Service URL**: https://sms-senderv2.onrender.com/

## ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### 🚀 Deployment
- ✅ Service deployed and live on Render
- ✅ PostgreSQL database configuration ready
- ✅ Redis/Celery configuration for background tasks
- ✅ Production settings optimized
- ✅ Database migrations applied successfully

### 🔗 TriboPay Webhook Integration
- ✅ **Real TriboPay webhook format captured and analyzed**
- ✅ **TribePayRealWebhookSerializer implemented** to handle actual data structure:
  - Nested `transaction` object with `id` and `amount`
  - Nested `customer` object with `phone_number`/`phone` fields
  - Root-level `status` and `method` fields
- ✅ **Webhook processing logic working correctly**
- ✅ **PIX payment detection and SMS scheduling logic validated**

### 📋 API Endpoints Testing

| Endpoint | Status | Function | Result |
|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| `/api/webhooks/health/` | ✅ | Health check | Service healthy, DB + cache connected |
| `/api/webhooks/tribopay-test/` | ✅ | Format validation | **PIX waiting → triggers SMS** |
| `/api/webhooks/tribopay-test/` | ✅ | Format validation | **Credit card paid → no SMS** |
| `/api/webhooks/events/` | ✅ | Event monitoring | Returns webhook events list |
| `/api/webhooks/debug/` | ✅ | Database status | Tables created, migrations applied |
| `/api/webhooks/force-migrate/` | ✅ | Manual migrations | Executes successfully |

### 🧪 Validation Tests Performed

#### Test 1: PIX Payment Waiting (Should Trigger SMS Recovery)
```json
{
  "status": "waiting",
  "method": "pix", 
  "customer": {"name": "João Silva", "phone_number": "+5511999999999"},
  "transaction": {"id": "pix_test_001", "amount": 7500}
}
```
**Result**: ✅ `"is_pix_waiting": true, "would_schedule_sms": true`

#### Test 2: Credit Card Paid (Should NOT Trigger SMS)
```json
{
  "status": "paid",
  "method": "credit_card",
  "customer": {"name": "Maria Santos", "phone_number": "+5511888888888"}, 
  "transaction": {"id": "cc_test_001", "amount": 12000}
}
```
**Result**: ✅ `"is_pix_waiting": false, "would_schedule_sms": false`

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS (Optional Production Setup)

### 1. Twilio SMS Configuration
```bash
# Set environment variables on Render dashboard:
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token  
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_number
```

### 2. Database & Redis Production Setup
- Configure PostgreSQL database on Render
- Configure Redis for Celery background tasks
- Update `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` environment variables

### 3. Switch to Production Webhook Endpoint
Update TriboPay webhook URL to use the main endpoint:
```
https://sms-senderv2.onrender.com/api/webhooks/tribopay/
```

## 📊 System Architecture Working

```
TriboPay → Webhook → Django API → Validation → Database Storage
                                      ↓
                              PIX + Waiting Status?
                                      ↓
                              Schedule SMS (10min delay)
                                      ↓
                              Celery Background Task
                                      ↓
                              Twilio SMS Service
```
